# Personal Kanban Board (KanMingBan)

## Introduction

KanMingBan is a CLI-based Personal Kanban Board written in pure C. It aims to provide a simple and lightweight solution for managing tasks without relying on heavy dependencies or external services. The name "KanMingBan" is derived from "看命板" which translates to "Life Lookup board" in Chinese.

## Motivation

The motivation behind KanMingBan was the lack of lightweight CLI-based Kanban board solutions. Existing alternatives either had limited features, heavy dependencies, or were tightly integrated with other tools like text editors or cloud services. KanMingBan aims to fill this gap by providing a simple, fast, and offline Kanban board experience.

## Philosophy

KanMingBan is designed to replace traditional sticky note Kanban boards. It focuses on offline usability and speed, aiming to provide a fast and efficient way to manage tasks without the need for cloud integration, advanced features, or heavy dependencies. The philosophy is to keep it simple and lightweight, resembling the traditional Kanban board experience.

- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Edit task names
- Task drilldown
- Task lifecycle management
- Task throughput analysis
- Basic GUI support (planned)

## Good to have:
