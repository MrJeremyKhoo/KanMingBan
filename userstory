Todo list (ordered) have a problem:
They get too long. and they cannot be a place for all the tasks in life
have to keep shuffling, priorities change.
can't keep track of what is in progress.

Have multiple to do list:
cannot order tasks sequence in different todo list

Have kanban board:
can keep track of progress. compare task across different domains. :))
